"""Provides classes for implementing Publisher / Subscriber relationships.

This module allows users to implement publisher / subscriber patterns in their
code by implementing an abstract class Subscriber and by utilizing the concrete
class Publisher to notify all attached subscribers of any update / notification.

Typical usage example:
  subscriber_a: Subscriber
  subscriber_b: Subscriber

  events = Publisher()
  events.subscribe(subscriber_a)
  events.subscribe(subscriber_b)

  events.notify("hello", "how are you")
  # subscribers A and B are called with update("hello", "how are you")

    This class is used as an interface for Publishers to contain a list of

    Publisher notifies an attached Subscriber about a new event.
